<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This vignette describes how to use the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>
package for analyzing and integrating the results from Differential
Expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>This package provides a Shiny application that aims to combine at
different levels the existing pieces of the transcriptome data and
results, in a way that makes it easier to generate insightful
observations and hypothesis - combining the benefits of interactivity
and reproducibility, e.g. by capturing the features and gene sets of
interest highlighted during the live session, and creating an HTML
report as an artifact where text, code, and output coexist.</p>
<p>In order to use <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>
in your workflow, the following inputs are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>dds</code>, a <code>DESeqDataSet</code> containing the
expression matrix;</li>
<li>
<code>res_de</code>, a <code>DESeqResults</code>, i.e. a
<code>DataFrame</code> storing the results of the differential
expression analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>res_enrich</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the results
of functional enrichment analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>annotation_obj</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the
correspondence between identifiers for the features under inspection in
the <code>dds</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow has mainly been tested with expression matrices with
Ensembl identifiers, which are consistent and unambiguous across
different releases, and results from functional enrichment analysis
originating from ORA (OverRepresentation Analysis) methods, on the Gene
Ontology signature database. It may need to be slightly adjusted to work
with other formats and sources, but the core functionality will remain
available.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this vignette, we will illustrate the main
features of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>
on a publicly available dataset from Alasoo, et al. “Shared genetic
effects on chromatin and gene expression indicate a role for enhancer
priming in immune response”, published in Nature Genetics, January 2018
<span class="citation">(Alasoo et al. 2018)</span> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7" class="external-link">doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7</a>.</p>
<p>The data is made available via the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/macrophage" class="external-link">macrophage</a></em>
Bioconductor package, which contains the files output from the Salmon
quantification (version 0.12.0, with Gencode v29 reference), as well as
the values summarized at the gene level, which we will use to
exemplify.</p>
<p>In the <code>macrophage</code> experimental setting, the samples are
available from 6 different donors, in 4 different conditions (naive,
treated with Interferon gamma, with SL1344, or with a combination of
Interferon gamma and SL1344). We will restrict our attention on the
comparison between Interferon gamma treated samples vs naive
samples.</p>

<p>Once installed, the package can be loaded and attached to your
current workspace as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st"><a href="https://github.com/federicomarini/GeneTonic" class="external-link">"GeneTonic"</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have all four input elements ready, you can launch the
<code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code> app by running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>In this vignette, we showcase the functionality of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>
using the gene-level summarized version of the <code>macrophage</code>
dataset. If you want to dive in and start playing with the app
immediately, you can simply run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/example.html" class="external-link">example</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>, ask <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, you can follow the next chunks of code to generate the
required input objects, step by step. In case some formatting
requirements are expected, these will be specified in the text/comments,
and they will be checked internally upon launching the
<code>GeneTonic</code> app.</p>
<p>For running <code>GeneTonic</code>, you will need the four components
mentioned above as parameters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dds</code>: First you will need a <code>DESeqDataSet</code>,
which is the main component in the <code>DESeq2</code> framework and
extends the widely adopted <code>SummarizedExperiment</code> class. This
object will store the information related to the expression matrix.</li>

<p><code>res_de</code>: Next you are going to need the results of
Differential Expression analysis, computed on the
<code>dds_macrophage</code> object you just obtained.</p>
<p>The expected format is a <code>DESeqResults</code> object. Here we
are going to contrast two different conditions, <code>IFNg</code> and
<code>naive</code>, while controlling for the cell line of origin (which
has 6 levels, namely naive, IFNg, IFNg_SL1344, and SL1344).</p>
<p>We start by filtering lowly expressed features (at least 10 counts in
at least 6 samples - 6 being the size of the smallest group). Then, we
test against a null hypothesis of a log2FoldChange of 1 (instead of the
default value of 0), in order to specify that we want to call DE genes
with a consistent <em>and</em> robust expression change. Finally, we add
the gene symbol to the output <code>DataFrame</code>.</p>

<p>We can do so by calling <code><a href="../reference/get_aggrscores.html">get_aggrscores()</a></code> on the

provided <code>res_enrich</code> object, <code>z_score</code> and
<code>aggr_score</code>, which summarize at the gene set level the
effect (log2FoldChange) of the differentially expressed genes which are
its members. In particular, the z score attempts to determine the

regardless of the effect size of the single members of the gene set.</p>

<p>From version 2.0.0 onwards, <code>GeneTonic</code> offers the

from within the <code>GeneTonic</code> app).<br>
This means it is possible to use <code>GeneTonic</code> also as a

<p>To upload your <code>GeneTonicList</code> object, click on the
“Browse” widget and select the specific RDS file from the explorer
window that will open up.<br>
If the upload was successful, <code>GeneTonic</code> will make all the
panels available, ready to be interactively explored. If providing the
data in a wrong or unexpected format, the app should be able to
recognize this and notify the users in the lower right corner.</p>

objects. Information on the format and content for this object type are
provided in the collapsible element on the right side of the dashboard
body.

<h2 id="userinterface">Description of the <code>GeneTonic</code> user interface<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#userinterface"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>GeneTonic</code> app is built with <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny" class="external-link">shiny</a></em>, and its
layout is built around the components of <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bs4Dash" class="external-link">bs4Dash</a></em>, a
modern looking dashboard based on Bootstrap 4.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="header-navbar">Header (navbar)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#header-navbar"></a>
</h3>
<p>The dashboard navbar (as it is called in <code>bs4Dash</code>)
contains two dropdown menus, which can be expanded by clicking on the
respective icons (<i class="fa fa-book"></i> and
<i class="fa fa-info"></i>). These provide additional buttons to do one
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-book"></i> - inspect the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>
vignette (either the one installed in bundle with the package, or the
online version)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> - read some first help
information on <code>GeneTonic</code> (what the package does in brief,
what is required to run properly)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> - display information about the
current session (via <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html" class="external-link">sessionInfo()</a></code>)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-heart"></i> - show some general information on
<em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>,
like where to find its development version (and contribute to that), or
how to cite this tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, one fundamental button is present in the navbar -
labeled “Bookmark”, with the heart <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> icon.
This serves the purpose of bookmarking genes and gene sets of interest
while exploring your data in an interactive session. This functionality
will be exploited in the <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> Bookmarks
section of the app, where a complete HTML report can be generated as a
reproducible artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sidebar">Sidebar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sidebar"></a>
</h3>
<p>On the left side of the app, by clicking on the
<i class="fa fa-bars"></i> menu bar icon (or if the app is viewed in
full screen, by simply moving the mouse over to the left side), the
sidebar menu is triggered. This constitutes the main way to access the
different tabs of <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code>, which will be explained in
more detail in the next section (@ref(functionality)).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="controlbar">Controlbar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#controlbar"></a>
</h3>
<p>The controlbar is triggered by clicking on the cogs
<i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> icon on the upper right part of the navbar.
There you can find widgets that control the appearance of output (plots,
tables, graphs) in multiple tabs of the main application, such as for
example the number of gene sets to focus your attention on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="body">Body<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#body"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main body of the <code>GeneTonic</code> application is structured
in tabs that are activated by clicking on the respective icons or text
in the sidebar.</p>
<p>While the Welcome tab might be self-explanatory, the functionality of
each tab can go in depth, and new users can benefit of the question
circle button (<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>) button to trigger
an interactive tour of <code>GeneTonic</code>, which allows users to
learn the basic usage mechanisms by doing. During a tour, the
highlighted elements respond to the user’s actions, while the rest of
the UI is kept shaded. Tours can be interrupted anytime by clicking
outside of the focused window, and arrows (left, right) can be used as
well to navigate between steps. The tour functionality is provided by
the beautiful <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rintrojs" class="external-link">rintrojs</a></em>
package.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="functionality">The <code>GeneTonic</code> functionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#functionality"></a>
</h2>
<p>The main <code>GeneTonic</code> app is structured in different
panels, and each of these is presented in detail in the subsequent
sections.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-welcome-panel">The Welcome panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-welcome-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel in intended to give an overview on the different
ingredients you just provided for launching <code>GeneTonic</code>.</p>
<p>Collapsible elements, colored each by the typology of data it refers
to, contain the underlying tabular information, and a value box provides
a quick summary on the dimensions of the input parameters.</p>
<p>The tables are rendered with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/DT/man/datatable.html" class="external-link">DT::datatable</a></code>, which
provides a practical interface for exploring, sorting, and filtering.
This framework is also extendable, for example as we do for the
<code>log2FoldChange</code> column in the <code>res_de</code> object,
where the values are also visually encoded as diverging bars of
different color based on the expression change direction.</p>
<p>In the Welcome panel, the GeneSpector box will also enable users to
explore a gene expression plot for any of the genes in the
<code>dds</code> object, irrespective of them being members or not of
any geneset.<br>
To do so, select a gene from the dropdown menu (autocompletion is
supported), and a covariate from the “Group/color by” selector in the
control menu on the right (opened by clicking on the cogs icon).</p>
<p>If launched without providing input data (as individual components,
or as <code>GeneTonicList</code> object), <code>GeneTonic</code> offers
the possibility to upload the <code>GeneTonicList</code> objects at
runtime.<br>
The upload functionality is showing in this panel, and enables
<code>GeneTonic</code> being used also as a server-like application for
internal deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-gene-geneset-panel">The Gene-Geneset panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-gene-geneset-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel has as its main component an interactive bipartite graph
illustrating the relationship between genesets and genes that belong to
them. One of the relevant parameters for this output is the number of
gene sets to be displayed, adjustable from the widget in the control
panel on the right.</p>
<p>Such a representation is particularly useful to see overlap between
terms, and grasp the way how different genes may play a concerting role
in different processes.</p>
<p>The color and shape of the nodes depend on the entity they are
related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>genes are shown as ellipses, colored with a palette diverging from a
neutral color to red (log2FC &gt; 0) or to blue (log2FC &lt; 0)</li>
<li>gene sets are enclosed in gold boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactivity in this graph is essential for zooming, panning,
and selecting its nodes. The node selection, in particular, triggers a
drill-down exploration, which populates a box on the right side, either
with a signature heatmap (for a gene set), or with an expression plot,
split by the experimental covariates of interest (for a gene) - this
behavior can be controlled by the “Group/color by” selectize widget in
the control sidebar. In both cases, some HTML content is also generated,
with buttons linking to external databases where to retrieve additional
information (e.g. ENSEMBL, NCBI, AmiGO, …).</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by
the tour, triggered by clicking on the question circle button
(<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>) button in the upper right corner
of the tab.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking from the Gene-Geneset panel:</strong> When
clicking on the Bookmark button while in this tab, it is possible to add
to the shortlisted items of interest both genes and gene sets. To do so,
while one of the nodes is selected, click on the button with the mouse -
or alternatively, click on the Left Ctrl button of your keyboard. A
notification will be triggered, informing the status of the bookmarked
elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-enrichment-map-panel">The Enrichment Map panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-enrichment-map-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel, similar to the Gene-Geneset tab, has again an interactive
graph of a subset of the gene sets (you can control again the number of
included sets from the control sidebar). This is also called an
enrichment map - it is also possible to generate them in tools such as
Cytoscape. In this case, the genesets are directly connected by an edge,
where the thickness encodes the degree of similarity (e.g. in terms of
overlap) between them; sets below a similarity threshold are not
displayed for the sake of better clarity.</p>
<p>The size of the node encodes the information of the number of genes
detected as Differentially Expressed (from the column
<code>gs_de_count</code>), while the color is representative of the
computed Z score for each set. This value is computed as <span class="math inline">\(z = \frac{(upgenes - downgenes)}{\sqrt{(upgenes +
downgenes)}}\)</span> and is indicative of the expression changes of the
genes assigned to a particular set. Please, keep in mind that methods
based on overrepresentation analysis only do not account for the
topology that might be behind the set of interacting features (i.e. an
upregulated gene involved in inhibition of a pathway would still be
counted as a positive element in the equation above).</p>
<p>The <code>z_score</code> and <code>aggr_score</code> (in the simplest
form, a mean of the log2FoldChange values for all the genes of a set)
can be easily computed with the <code><a href="../reference/get_aggrscores.html">get_aggrscores()</a></code>, which
appends these scores for each gene set to the original
<code>res_enrich</code> data frame.</p>
<p>The interactive flavor in this tab permits a quick exploration of the
signature heatmaps for the genesets of interest by simply clicking on a
node; this also triggers the display of some HTML content, if related to
a Gene Ontology term.</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by
the tour, triggered by clicking on the question circle button
(<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>) button in the upper right corner
of the tab.</p>
<p>In the section below the interactive enrichment map, the
functionality for the <em>distillation</em> of gene sets into
meta-genesets is provided.<br>
In brief, a community detection algorithm is run on the graph underlying
the enrichment map, and the additional information extracted is rendered
as a table, linked to a meta-geneset box to display the expression
signature for all its member genes.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking from the Enrichment Map panel:</strong> If the
user clicks on the Bookmark button while in this tab, it will add the
selected node to the shortlist of genesets, visible later in the
Bookmarks panel. The Left Ctrl button of your keyboard can again be used
for this purpose, and this will trigger a notification in the lower
right part of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-overview-panel">The Overview panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-overview-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel presents to the user a series of summary plots, based on
the outputs of <code><a href="../reference/enhance_table.html">enhance_table()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/gs_volcano.html">gs_volcano()</a></code>, aiming to provide a mean to summarize the
most relevant genesets in the <code>res_enrich</code> object. The number
of displayed (or labeled, according to each function) genesets can be as
usual controlled by the widget in the right sidebar.</p>
<p>We avoid (re)rendering all plots at once by placing them as content
of different tabs in a <code>bs4TabCard</code> container - this allows
the user to navigate in a more agile way to the desired output
elements.</p>
<p>Interactive versions of the plots are returned via calls to
<code>ggplotly</code>.</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by
the tour, triggered by clicking on the question circle button
(<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>) button in the upper right corner

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-gsviz-panel">The GSViz panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-gsviz-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel, similarly to the Overview panel, presents a variety of
plots visualizing the gene sets - and their mutual relationships, or
their behavior across samples. This includes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a genesets by sample heatmap (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_scores.html">gs_scores()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/gs_scoresheat.html">gs_scoresheat()</a></code>), with a score for each matrix element
corresponding to the sum of the standardized expression values of its
components</li>
<li>a genesets-gene Sankey diagram (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_alluvial.html">gs_alluvial()</a></code>,
aliased to <code><a href="../reference/gs_alluvial.html">gs_sankey()</a></code>), to represent the N:N membership
relationships</li>
<li>a summary heatmap (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_heat.html">gs_summary_heat()</a></code>) to display
the memberships and at the same time the expression change of each gene
set member</li>
<li>a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot, based on
<code><a href="../reference/gs_mds.html">gs_mds()</a></code>, to provide a 2d visualization of the distance
among genesets (based on a similarity measure e.g. their overlap or
other criteria, such as their semantic similarity)</li>
<li>a compact summary of <code>res_enrich</code>, via
<code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview.html">gs_summary_overview()</a></code>, where aggregated scores and
significance can be displayed on the same plot - for this, there are
functions to compare different <code>res_enrich</code> objects
(<code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview.html">gs_summary_overview()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview_pair.html">gs_summary_overview_pair()</a></code>)</li>
<li>alternative visual representation of the <code>res_enrich</code>
objects, based on <code><a href="../reference/gs_radar.html">gs_radar()</a></code> (equivalent to
<code><a href="../reference/gs_radar.html">gs_spider()</a></code>) and <code><a href="../reference/gs_dendro.html">gs_dendro()</a></code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As in many other panels, the control over the number of genesets
displayed is tweaked with the widget in the right sidebar, “Number of
genesets”.</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by
the tour, triggered by clicking on the question circle button
(<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>) button in the upper right corner
of the tab.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-bookmarks-panel">The Bookmarks panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-bookmarks-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this panel, the user can obtain a complete overview on the
bookmarked features of interest, both genes (left side) and genesets
(right side).</p>
<p>During a live exploration session, it might be tricky to recall the
exact aspect of each point of interest.</p>
<p>Below the interactive <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/DT/man/datatable.html" class="external-link">DT::datatable</a></code> objects, the content
of each table can also be separately downloaded by clicking on the
respective button. Moreover, there is a button (with the cocktail icon
<i class="fa fa-cocktail"></i>) that triggers the generation of a
content-rich report which will focus on all the shortlisted elements.
This leverages a template report delivered as a part of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>,
which accesses the input elements and the reactive values for the
bookmarks, based on the <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>If a user already knows a set of features and geneset of interest, it
is also possible to practically call <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> directly
from the command line (see the example in the chunk below). Please keep
in mind that the identifiers to be used should match the values used as
row names of the <code>dds</code> object and as <code>gs_id</code>

<p>Ideally, each live session with <code>GeneTonic</code> could
terminate with a call to <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> - admittedly, an
aperitivo should start with that, and not end - please accept our
apologies :) .</p>

possibility to summarize the result of enrichment is by
applying fuzzy clustering on it to detect groups of related genesets,
with the peculiarity that a geneset can belong to different clusters -
this reflects the original implementation of DAVID <span class="citation">(Huang, Sherman, and Lempicki 2009)</span>.<br>
The <code><a href="../reference/gs_fuzzyclustering.html">gs_fuzzyclustering()</a></code> function returns a table with
additional columns, related to the cluster id and the status for the
geneset in that cluster (“Representative” or “Member”, where the
Representative geneset is the one with lowest p-value in that
cluster).</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#faqs"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Why is this package called
<code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: For obvious reasons :) Like in a cocktail, ingredients (expression
matrix, results from DE, and results from functional enrichment
analysis) do taste better together.<br>
Plus, I like puns with words.<br>
And cocktails.<br>
Sometimes simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My configuration on two machines is somewhat different, so
I am having difficulty in finding out what packages are different. Is
there something to help on this?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can check out <em><a href="https://github.com/federicomarini/sessionDiffo" class="external-link">sessionDiffo</a></em>,
a small utility to compare the outputs of two different
<code>sessionInfo</code> outputs. This can help you pinpoint what
packages might be causing the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am using a different service/software for generating the
results of functional enrichment analysis. How do I plug this into
<code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can set up a small conversion function, on the line of
<code>shake_topGOtableResult</code> and <code>shake_enrichResult</code>
(<em>use the source, Luke</em> to see how you can build your own), or
request such a function - make sure to specify the formatting
specifications of your tool of choice (e.g. DAVID, g:Profiler, or
commercial solutions such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis).<br>
As of Bioconductor release 3.12 (version &gt;= 1.2.0 for <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>),
shaker functions are available for these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>DAVID</code> (<a href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/" class="external-link uri">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</a>), with the result exported in
text format</li>
<li>
<code>topGO</code> (available in the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/topGO" class="external-link">topGO</a></em>
package), as in the wrapper function provided by <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/pcaExplorer" class="external-link">pcaExplorer</a></em>,
<code>pcaExplorer::topGOtable()</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Enrichr</code> (<a href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/" class="external-link uri">https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</a>), either from text
format or from a call via the <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=enrichr" class="external-link">enrichr</a></em>
package</li>
<li>
<code>fgsea</code>, taking the output of the workflow from the
<em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/fgsea" class="external-link">fgsea</a></em>
package</li>
<li>
<code>g:Profiler</code> (<a href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/" class="external-link uri">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/</a>), either from text file
format or with the output of <code>gost()</code> in <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gprofiler2" class="external-link">gprofiler2</a></em>
</li>
<li>
<code>clusterProfiler</code>, providing <code>enrichResult</code>
objects, commonly returned by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/clusterProfiler/man/enrichGO.html" class="external-link">enrichGO()</a></code> from <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/clusterProfiler" class="external-link">clusterProfiler</a></em>
or <code>enrichPathway()</code> from <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/ReactomePA" class="external-link">ReactomePA</a></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: I’d like to try <code>GeneTonic</code> but I could not
install it/I just want a quick peek into it. What can I do for
this?</strong></p>
<p>A: We set up an instance of <code>GeneTonic</code> running on the
<code>macrophage</code> dataset at this address: <a href="http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic" class="external-link uri">http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic</a>.</p>
