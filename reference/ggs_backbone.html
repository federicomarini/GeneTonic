    <div id="arguments">
    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>res_enrich</dt>
<dd><p>A <code>data.frame</code> object, storing the result of the functional
enrichment analysis. See more in the main function, <code><a href="GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code>, to check the
formatting requirements (a minimal set of columns should be present).</p></dd>


<dt>res_de</dt>
<dd><p>A <code>DESeqResults</code> object.</p></dd>


<dt>annotation_obj</dt>
<dd><p>A <code>data.frame</code> object with the feature annotation
information, with at least two columns, <code>gene_id</code> and <code>gene_name</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>gtl</dt>
<dd><p>A <code>GeneTonic</code>-list object, containing in its slots the arguments
specified above: <code>dds</code>, <code>res_de</code>, <code>res_enrich</code>, and <code>annotation_obj</code> - the names
of the list <em>must</em> be specified following the content they are expecting</p></dd>


<dt>n_gs</dt>
<dd><p>Integer value, corresponding to the maximal number of gene sets to
be included</p></dd>


<dt>gs_ids</dt>
<dd><p>Character vector, containing a subset of <code>gs_id</code> as they are
available in <code>res_enrich</code>. Lists the gene sets to be included in addition to
the top ones (via <code>n_gs</code>)</p></dd>


<dt>bb_on</dt>
<dd><p>A character string, either "genesets" or "features", to specify which
entity should be based the backbone graph on.</p></dd>


<dt>bb_method</dt>
<dd><p>A character string, referring to the function to be called (
from the <code>backbone</code> package) for computing the backbone of the specified
bipartite graph. Defaults to "sdsm", as recommended in the <code>backbone</code> package.</p></dd>


<dt>bb_extract_alpha</dt>
<dd><p>A numeric value, specifying the significance level to
use when detecting the backbone of the network</p></dd>


<dt>bb_extract_fwer</dt>
<dd><p>A character string, defaulting to "none", specifying
which method to use for the multiple testing correction for controlling the
family-wise error rate</p></dd>


<dt>bb_fullinfo</dt>
<dd><p>Logical value, determining what will be returned as output:
either a simple <code>ìgraph</code> object with the graph backbone (if set to <code>FALSE</code>),
or a list object containing also the <code>backbone</code> object, and the gene-geneset
graph used for the computation (if <code>TRUE</code>)</p></dd>


<dt>bb_remove_singletons</dt>
<dd><p>Logical value, defines whether to remove or leave
in the returned graph the nodes that are not connected to other vertices</p></dd>


<dt>color_graph</dt>
<dd><p>Logical value, specifies whether to use information about
genesets or features to colorize the nodes, e.g. for this info to be used in
interactive versions of the graph</p></dd>


<dt>color_by_geneset</dt>
<dd><p>Character string, corresponding to the column in
<code>res_enrich</code> to be used for coloring the nodes if <code>bb_on</code> is set to "genesets".
Defaults to the "z_score", which can be obtained via <code><a href="get_aggrscores.html">get_aggrscores()</a></code></p></dd>


<dt>color_by_feature</dt>
<dd><p>Character string, corresponding to the column in
<code>res_de</code> to be used for coloring the nodes if <code>bb_on</code> is set to "features".

DESeqResults object.</p></dd>


<dt>...</dt>
<dd><p>Additional parameters to be passed internally</p></dd>

</dl></div>
    <div id="value">
    <h2>Value</h2>
    

<p>According to the <code>bb_fullinfo</code>, either a simple <code>ìgraph</code> object with
the graph backbone, or a named list object containing:</p><ul><li><p>the <code>igraph</code> of the extracted backbone</p></li>
