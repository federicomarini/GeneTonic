\title{A sample output from Enrichr}
\description{
A sample output object as created from a call to Enrichr, with the interface
provided by \code{enrichR} - using the \code{enrichr()} function
}
\details{
This object has been created on the data from the \code{macrophage} package
by analyzing downstream the differentially expressed genes
when comparing IFNg treated samples vs naive samples, accounting
for the different cell lines included.

Details on how this object has been created are included in the \code{create_gt_data.R}
script, included in the \code{scripts} folder of the \code{GeneTonic} package.
