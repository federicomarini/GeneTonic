Description: This package provides a Shiny application that aims to combine at 
    different levels the existing pieces of the transcriptome data and results, 
    in a way that makes it easier to generate insightful observations and 
    hypothesis - combining the benefits of interactivity and reproducibility, 
    e.g. by capturing the features and gene sets of interest highlighted during 
    the live session, and creating an HTML report as an artifact where text, 
    code, and output coexist.
